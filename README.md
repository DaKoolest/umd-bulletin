# UMD Bulletin

UMD Bulletin is a project I am working on that acts as a **digital bulletin board**, allowing users to **pin posts and photos to specific locations** around the University of Maryland campus. Me and my roommate love exploring campus and finding weird and interesting locations, and we wanted to be able to document our explorations somewhere. Originally we wanted to make a physical map, but we quickly realized it would have to be massive to fit the number photos and notes that we were imagining. Thus, this project was born...

With UMD Bulletin, users can currently:

-   **Create posts** with text and images attached to precise campus locations.
-   **View posts** pinned near them or in specific areas of interest.
-   **Like posts** and interact with the community in a location-based context.
-   **Comment on posts**, allowing discussions to happen around events or announcements..

The project leverages technologies like **MapLibre** and **Clerk authentication** to create a **secure** geospatial data platform.

In the future, we aim to **expand UMD Bulletinâ€™s functionality** by adding features such as:

-   **Filtering and search** by categories, keywords, or specific areas on campus.
-   **Event scheduling and reminders** for campus activities.
-   **Mobile Support** for a seamless experience on phones and tablets.
